I copied the code from https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/Javidx9/blob/master/SimplyCode/OneLoneCoder_Tetris.cpp#L137
I adjusted it to work in C and linux using ncurses, I also made some extra functions, for example a function for delete lines.


gameplay:
left arroe and right arrow to move
up arrow to rotate
down arrow to accelerate
x to drop the piece
